<h1>Heart Disease Prediction</h1>
<p>In this project, I build a Machine Learning model and a simple interface using the Framingham Heart Study dataset which is dedicated to identifying common characteristics that contribute to Cardiovascular Diseases. The dataset includes over 4,240 records of individuals on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gender</li>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Whether they are smokers</li>
  <li>How many cigarettes they smoke in a day</li>
  <li>Whether they are on Blood Pressure Medications</li>
  <li>Total Cholestrol</li>
  <li>Systolic Blood Pressure</li>
  <li>Diastolic Blood Pressure</li>
  <li>Body Mass Index (BMI)</li>
  <li>Heart Rate</li>
  <li>Glucose</li>
</ul>
<p>In the project, I use Random Forest Classifier. It creates multiple decision trees during training and each tree trained on a random subset of data. During prediction, the model combines predictions of these trees to make a final prediction. I used ensembling to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting</p>
